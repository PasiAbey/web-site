    <h3>Coral Reefs</h3>
    <p>The coral reefs of Sri Lanka are vibrant ecosystems, vital to the maritime health and attracting a plethora of marine life. These underwater landscapes are densely populated with a variety of corals, such as brain corals, staghorn corals, and many soft coral species. These reefs provide shelter and food for hundreds of species of colorful fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, making them excellent spots for snorkeling and diving.

    <h3>Fish Diversity</h3>
    <p>Sri Lanka’s waters are teeming with both reef-associated and pelagic fish species. Divers can marvel at the sight of angelfish, butterflyfish, and clownfish around the reefs, while larger species such as tuna, marlin, and even the majestic sailfish are found in deeper waters. The rich diversity creates a dynamic environment that is both crucial for local fishermen and captivating for eco-tourists. </br></br>

    <h3>Marine Mammals</h3>
    <p>The ocean around Sri Lanka is one of the best places in the world for observing marine mammals, particularly dolphins and whales. The deep waters off the coast serve as a migration path for several whale species, including the blue whale, the largest animal on the planet. Dolphin watching is also popular, with species like the playful spinner dolphins and powerful bottlenose dolphins commonly seen frolicking in the waters.

    <h3>Sea Turtles</h3>
    <p>Sri Lanka is critical to the survival of several species of sea turtles, which come ashore to nest on its sandy beaches. The island's coastal areas see regular nesting from the green turtle, leatherback turtle, hawksbill turtle, and loggerhead turtle. Conservation programs and sanctuaries such as those at Kosgoda and Rekawa Beach are instrumental in protecting these vulnerable species from extinction.

    <h3>Mangroves and Estuaries</h3>
    <p>The mangrove ecosystems and estuaries of Sri Lanka are nurseries for many marine species. These areas are rich in nutrients and serve as breeding and feeding grounds for a variety of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. They also act as important buffers, protecting the inland from coastal erosion and helping to filter pollutants before they reach the ocean.</br></br>
